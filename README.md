# 06-DESIGN-AND-ANALYSIS-OF-MICROSTRIP-ANTENNA-USING-CST-MICROWAVE-STUDIO (SCHEMATIC)

**Aim of the Experiment:** To design a quarter wave transformer for matching a 50 Ohm microstrip line with a load of 123 Ohms Software to be used: CST studio suite 2019 (Student edition)

**Design:**

RF system architecture can be implemented using RF System models available in the Analog/RF library

**Conclusion:**

The quarter wave transformer was succesfully designed using CST Microwave studio to match mico strip line with a 123 ohm load.

thus  the microstrip antenna is designed and analysed using CST MICROWAVE STUDIO
